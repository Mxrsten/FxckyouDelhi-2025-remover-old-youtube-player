# FxckYouDelhi
This is a project generated by me via Claude (yes I am talentless and don't know JavaScript) aimed at removing Delhi (2025 new youtube design) which I don't like. 

Step-by-step installation:
1. Install the Tampermonkey extension for your browser
2.  Click “Create a new script”, and enter there the contents of the file attached in the repository.
3. When you go to youtube, click on the extension and enable userscript
